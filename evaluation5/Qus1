Question -1
________________



The ORm software performs lazy loading by default that means while loading object the parent level data only will loaded
child level data will not loaded without calling it and if we try to access child level data it will thow exception .
To overcome this problem we can over come by eager loading method .For that we have to use
(fetch=FetchType.EAGER) in the embaded table
