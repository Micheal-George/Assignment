ORM in hibernate
   Hibernate is one of the ORM based framework software and one of the most used JPA implementation .
   Hibernate provides its own api to develop ORM based persistence logic
   
   
   Cascade
    If we use cascading option, once we persist the parent object automatically all the child
     object also should be persisted eg:(cascade= CascadeType.ALL)
     we have to give this annotation above child object
     
   @mappedBy
      When we are handling JPA relationship there will be chance of creating an extra table to maintain the
      relationship b/w the existing tables. so instead of using 3rd table use the existing table refernce we use
       "mappedBy" property inside the @OneToMany annotation with the value:- the variable defined in another side.
